### Terrminology

**Origin Language**: The origin language of your document/webpage. This is the language that you will regularly update to add new content.

**Target Languages**: All the languages you want to support

**Rules**: All the translation rules you want to be applied during translation.

**Translation Paths**: All the paths you want the Frenglish bot to parse through to translate the files in that directory. Can also have path to specific files.

**Auto-Merge**: Option to create a Pull Request on a new branch based on the branch where you edited an origin language translation file or will auto-merge the new translation files into your branch.

**Rules per language**: Allows you to specify language specific rules for all the languages you want to support

## Manage translation settings in your repository

1. Install the Frenglish bot for your selected repositories you want to apply translations to
2. Create a `frenglishConfig.json` in your root directory
3. Configure all translation settings inside the json:

```json
{
    "originLanguage": "en",
    "languages": ["fr", "ja", "es"],
    "rules": "Do not translate Frenglish",
    "translationPaths": ["docs/locales/*"],
    "autoMergeToBaseBranch": false,
    "rulesPerLanguage": [
      {
         "language": "fr",
         "rules": "French rule 1"
      },
      {
         "language": "ja",
         "rules": "Japanese rule 1"
      }
     ],
    "useThisConfig": true
}
```

**originLanguage**: Specify the origin language of your document/webpage. This is the language that you will regularly update to add new content.

**languages**: Specify all the languages you want to support in a string array.

**rules**: In a string, specify all the translation rules you want. These rules will be applied to all translation files.

**translationPaths**: Specify all the paths you want the Frenglish bot to parse through to translate all the files in that directory.

**autoMergeToBaseBranch**: Boolean option - **False** will create a Pull Request on a new branch based on the branch where you edited an origin language translation file. **True** will auto-merge the new translation files into your branch.

**rulesPerLanguage**: Allows you to specify language specific rules for all the languages you want to support

**useThisConfig**: Since we offer the option to configure your translation on www.frenglish.ai, setting this boolean will ensure you are using the json config instead of the one you created on the website. However, if we don't find a `frenglishConfig.json` in your root directory, we will utilize the translation settings you configured on the website. You could also set this to "false", so that we utilize the configuration on the website.
