# Introduction {#introduction}

⏱️ Frenglish helps you generate new translation content or keep existing translations up to date **in no time**.

💸 Keeping all your translation files up to date is expensive and time-consuming. Using Frenglish's integrated automation tool, you can forget about maintaining any of your supported languages. 

🌐 If your website uses i18n, our tool will directly generate and maintain your translation files.

📊 No need to learn how to use a new dashboard or new GUI. All localization is automated and managed in your Github repository.

## Features {#features}

Frenglish is built with a strong focus on the developer and content manager experience.

    - JSON (.json)
    - HTML (.html)
    - Doc files (.docx)

  - Never worry about translations again
  - All users that have access to your Github repository will have the translation support
- **Natural Learning**:
  - The longer you use Frenglish, the more attuned our bot will be to your needs. The Frenglish bot learns anytime you make a change in Frenglish translated files and applies those learnings to all future translations.
  - The bot runs through multiple reflections and reviews to evaluation translations and see how it can improve them before you see the final translation files.
- **Quick lead times**:
  - Compared to other translation services on the market, no matter how many translation files you need, they will be ready in minutes. No need to wait days or weeks to receive your translation files!
- **Cost efficient**:
  - We only translate the sections you modified. Therefore, if you have an existing translated file, we will parse through that file and only translate content that changed. This is all done automatically for you.
  - We designed this product for start-ups and companies that don't want to spend a big budget on translations. We want your company to succeed and to unlock new audiences ASAP with low cost.

## Frenglish's commitment

We ensure this tool is easy to use by dogfooding our product regularly (using the Frenglish bot internally) and listening to our feedback. Our website is open-source for you to see how we implemented i18n for our webpages and serves as an example of the quality of our translations. Additionally, you can see how the bot creates the PRs for translation files.

We ensure great translation quality by going through many iterations of AI reflection, reviews, and learnings. If you make any modifications to a translation file that is not in the origin language, our AI will implicitly learn from these changes and apply them in future translations.

We regularly perform quality assurance tests on our translation files by running standardized translation tests like the METEOR score, sending them to human translators, and continuously gathering user feedback.
